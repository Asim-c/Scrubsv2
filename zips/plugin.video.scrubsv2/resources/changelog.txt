- Changed way too much to list lol.(along with the removal of pretty much all debrid stuff.)
- Converted older versions of TheOath and Scrubs into this strange thing.
- Updated for Kodi 19.0 Based off Host505 Changes mostly. and a few from other folks also.
- Now designed to be english only and supporting Kodi 19 only.(I dont use older versions.)
- Stuffed with likely twice the shit and probably half the size.(plus surprisingly speedy.)
- As the first update, expect problems and report em for me to fix em.(apoligies in advance.)
